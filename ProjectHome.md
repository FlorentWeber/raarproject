The RAAR Project is an academic project which goal is to create a C/MPI code generator using [MetaScribe](http://move.lip6.fr/software/METASCRIBE/). Our code generator takes as input a partitioned Petri-Net and generates a distributed application.
The output language is C, and uses the [MPI library](http://www.open-mpi.org/) as network layer.

This approach allows to bring Model Driven Engineering to distributed applications development.

This project also contains a [Coloane](http://coloane.lip6.fr/) to MSM encoder ([ModelParser](http://code.google.com/p/raarproject/source/browse/#svn/trunk/ModelParser)).
